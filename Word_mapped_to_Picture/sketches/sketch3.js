It can set the mood, attract attention and even spark emotions â€“ in some cases, it can cause physical reactions, so it is important to get right. Whether designing something for yourself or a client, your choice of hue for logos, campaigns, websites or advertisements will massively determine how the brand is perceived by the public. With this in mind, youll want to ensure you choose the right palette to win over the target customer.';
