# GenerativeDesignProjects

## This is a generative design repo containing a collection of p5.js sketches. Playing around with Colour, Shape and Type.

* p5.js is a JavaScript library that starts with the original goal of Processing, to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners, and reinterprets this for today's web.

* Each directory contains its own sketch.
* There will be a link to every sketch in each directories readMe file.

* Here are some examples(GIF) of the work that is found throughout this repository
